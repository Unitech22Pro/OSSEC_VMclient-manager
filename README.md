# **_OSSEC Client & Manager VM Deployment + Setup_**

This project demonstrates a foundational hands-on lab in host-based intrusion detection using OSSEC (Open Source Security Event Correlator). The lab simulates an enterprise-like environment by deploying an OSSEC Manager on a Linux VM and an OSSEC Agent on a Windows VM, configured to securely communicate in a host-only virtual network.

🔍 This lab focuses on deployment, architecture, and secure registration of agents. 

📌 Project Objectives

✅ Set up a secure virtual environment using VMware and host-only networking

✅ Deploy an OSSEC Manager on an Ubuntu VM

✅ Install an OSSEC Agent on a Windows VM

✅ Perform secure agent registration with the manager

✅ Confirm client-server communication in a simulated lab network
